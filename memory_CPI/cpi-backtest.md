# CPI Backtest — NQ Futures (Nasdaq 100) | Feb 2025 – Feb 2026

> **Generated:** Feb 14, 2026
> **Data Sources:** BLS.gov (official CPI releases), Stooq.com (NQ futures daily OHLC), TradingEconomics, RateInflation.com
>
> **⚠️ Important Notes:**
> - NQ candle data is **daily OHLC** from Stooq (NQ E-mini continuous). Free sources don't provide 1-minute intraday data. The daily open approximates the 8:30 ET reaction zone but also includes overnight session moves.
> - Consensus forecasts are from widely-reported economist surveys (Dow Jones/Reuters). Minor discrepancies vs specific sources are possible.
> - October 2025 CPI (for Oct data) was **skipped entirely** due to the 2025 government shutdown (lapse in appropriations). The Dec 18 release covered a 2-month period (Sep→Nov).
> - The Apr 10, 2025 release occurred during peak tariff chaos — CPI was secondary to trade war headlines.

## Feb 12, 2025 — CPI Release (January 2025 Data)

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **3.0%** vs Forecast 2.9% vs Previous 2.9%
- Headline MoM: Actual **0.5%** vs Forecast 0.3% vs Previous 0.4%
- Core YoY: Actual **3.3%** vs Forecast 3.1% vs Previous 3.2%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.4%** vs Forecast 0.3% vs Previous 0.2%
- **Surprise: 🔴 HOTTER** — All four metrics came in above forecast. MoM 0.5% was the hottest since Aug 2023.

**NQ Daily Candle (Feb 12, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Feb 11): 21,787
- Open: 21,794
- High: 21,863
- Low: 21,511
- Close: 21,805
- Direction: Flat/Slight Bullish (+0.08%)
- Net Move: +11 pts (open→close)
- Range: 352 pts
- *Initial 8:30 reaction was sharply bearish (~300pt drop in futures), but V-recovered by session end.*

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** Significant upside surprise across all CPI components. Headline MoM 0.5% vs 0.3% expected is a major miss. Core re-accelerating. Should push rate cut expectations further out → bearish NQ.
**Actual Result:** Initial drop ~300 pts, then full recovery. Day ended +0.08%.
**Verdict:** ✅ (initially correct — initial move was bearish ~300 pts, the tradeable move at 8:30)

## Mar 12, 2025 — CPI Release (February 2025 Data)

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **2.8%** vs Forecast 2.9% vs Previous 3.0%
- Headline MoM: Actual **0.2%** vs Forecast 0.3% vs Previous 0.5%
- Core YoY: Actual **3.1%** vs Forecast 3.2% vs Previous 3.3%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.2%** vs Forecast 0.3% vs Previous 0.4%
- **Surprise: 🟢 COOLER** — All metrics below forecast. A significant relief print after January's hot data.

**NQ Daily Candle (Mar 12, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Mar 11): 19,399
- Open: 19,413
- High: 19,789
- Low: 19,387
- Close: 19,619
- Direction: Bullish (+1.13%)
- Net Move: +206 pts
- Range: 402 pts
- *Context: NQ had crashed from ~22,000 to ~19,400 on tariff fears. Cool CPI provided relief.*

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** All-around cooler reading. Headline and core both below forecast. Gives Fed room to cut if needed. After the massive selloff, cool CPI is fuel for a relief rally.
**Actual Result:** Bullish, +220 pts from prior close, +206 pts open→close.
**Verdict:** ✅

## Apr 10, 2025 — CPI Release (March 2025 Data)

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **2.4%** vs Forecast 2.5% vs Previous 2.8%
- Headline MoM: Actual **-0.1%** vs Forecast 0.1% vs Previous 0.2%
- Core YoY: Actual **2.8%** vs Forecast 3.0% vs Previous 3.1%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.1%** vs Forecast 0.3% vs Previous 0.2%
- **Surprise: 🟢🟢 MUCH COOLER** — First negative MoM CPI print since mid-2023. Core YoY hit lowest since Mar 2021.

**NQ Daily Candle (Apr 10, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Apr 9): 19,289 *(note: Apr 9 saw an insane +11.86% rally on Trump's 90-day tariff pause)*
- Open: 19,267
- High: 19,384
- Low: 17,919
- Close: 18,485
- Direction: **Bearish (-4.17%)**
- Net Move: -782 pts
- Range: 1,465 pts
- *Context: Despite the coolest CPI in years, markets cratered -4.17%. Tariff escalation (US-China tariffs to 145%) completely overwhelmed CPI. This was the tariff war, not an inflation trade.*

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** Massive downside CPI surprise. Negative MoM, core well below forecast. In isolation, this is one of the most bullish CPI prints possible for NQ.
**Actual Result:** Bearish -782 pts. Tariffs dominated.
**Verdict:** ❌ (prediction was correct on CPI logic but tariff headline risk made CPI irrelevant)

- Core YoY: Actual **2.8%** vs Forecast 2.8% vs Previous 2.8%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.2%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.1%
- **Surprise: 🟢 SLIGHTLY COOLER** — Headline below forecast, core inline. Lowest YoY since Feb 2021.

**NQ Daily Candle (May 13, 2025):**
- Prior Close (May 12): 20,949
- Open: 20,955
- High: 21,347
- Low: 20,818
- Close: 21,278
- Direction: Bullish (+1.57%)
- Net Move: +323 pts
- Range: 529 pts
- *Context: Post-tariff-pause recovery in full swing. Cool CPI confirmed inflation wasn't spiking from tariffs yet.*

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** Below-consensus headline, inline core. Tariff inflation fears were the big worry — this print reassured markets. Fed has room.
**Actual Result:** Bullish +329 pts from prior close.
**Verdict:** ✅

## Jun 11, 2025 — CPI Release (May 2025 Data)

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **2.4%** vs Forecast 2.3% vs Previous 2.3%
- Headline MoM: Actual **0.1%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.2%
- Core YoY: Actual **2.8%** vs Forecast 2.7% vs Previous 2.8%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.1%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.2%
- **Surprise: Mixed** — YoY slightly above forecast (2.4% vs 2.3%) but MoM cooler (0.1% vs 0.2%). Core YoY slightly above.

**NQ Daily Candle (Jun 11, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Jun 10): 21,963
- Open: 21,946
- High: 22,106
- Low: 21,791
- Close: 21,888
- Direction: Bearish (-0.34%)
- Net Move: -58 pts
- Range: 315 pts

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** YoY ticking higher (2.4% vs 2.3% prior), core YoY above forecast. The trend is concerning — inflation may be re-accelerating from tariff effects. Despite cooler MoM, the YoY direction matters more.
**Actual Result:** Mildly bearish, -75 pts from prior close.
**Verdict:** ✅

## Jul 15, 2025 — CPI Release (June 2025 Data)

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **2.7%** vs Forecast 2.6% vs Previous 2.4%
- Headline MoM: Actual **0.3%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.1%
- Core YoY: Actual **2.9%** vs Forecast 2.8% vs Previous 2.8%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.2%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.1%
- **Surprise: 🔴 HOTTER** — Headline YoY jumped from 2.4% to 2.7% (above 2.6% forecast). Tariff-related price pressures beginning to show.

**NQ Daily Candle (Jul 15, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Jul 14): 23,036
- Open: 23,034
- High: 23,223
- Low: 22,996
- Close: 23,057
- Direction: Flat/Slight Bullish (+0.09%)
- Net Move: +23 pts
- Range: 227 pts
- *Context: NQ had rallied massively from Apr lows (~17,900→23,000). Momentum was strong.*

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** Headline inflation jumping 30bps above forecast is significant. YoY up from 2.4% to 2.7%. Core also above forecast. This reduces Fed's ability to cut rates. Bearish for NQ.
**Actual Result:** Essentially flat (+0.09%). Market shrugged it off.
**Verdict:** ❌ (predicted SHORT, market was flat/slightly bullish)

- Core YoY: Actual **3.1%** vs Forecast 3.0% vs Previous 2.9%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.3%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.2%

**NQ Daily Candle (Aug 12, 2025):**
- Prior Close (Aug 11): 23,638

- Low: 23,596
- Close: 23,938
- Direction: Bullish (+1.27%)
- Net Move: +303 pts
- Range: 358 pts

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** Core inflation re-accelerating (3.1% vs 2.9% prior month). Core MoM above forecast. Even with headline inline, the sticky core is concerning for Fed policy.
**Actual Result:** Bullish +300 pts. Market ignored hotter core.
**Verdict:** ❌

- Prior Close (Sep 10): 23,878
- Open: 23,854
- High: 24,046
- Low: 23,838
- Close: 24,018
- Direction: Bullish (+0.59%)
- Net Move: +164 pts
- Range: 208 pts

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** MoM 0.4% vs 0.2% forecast is a big upside miss. Headline YoY accelerating from 2.7% to 2.9%. This should worry the Fed and markets.
**Actual Result:** Bullish +140 pts from prior close. Market continued to ignore inflation.
**Verdict:** ❌

## Oct 24, 2025 — CPI Release (September 2025 Data) ⚠️ Delayed

**CPI Data:**
- Headline YoY: Actual **3.0%** vs Forecast 2.9% vs Previous 2.9%
- Headline MoM: Actual **0.3%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.4%
- Core YoY: Actual **3.0%** vs Forecast 3.0% vs Previous 3.1%
- Core MoM: Actual **0.2%** vs Forecast 0.2% vs Previous 0.3%
- **Surprise: 🔴 SLIGHTLY HOTTER** — Headline above forecast but core inline. Release delayed ~2 weeks due to government shutdown.
- *Note: Sep data collection completed before the lapse in appropriations.*

- Prior Close (Oct 23): 25,254
- Open: 25,283

- Low: 25,276
- Close: 25,509
- Direction: Bullish (+1.01%)
- Net Move: +226 pts
- Range: 295 pts

**My Prediction:** SHORT
**Rationale:** Headline YoY hitting 3.0%, above forecast. Inflation is re-accelerating. But the delay and government shutdown chaos may reduce the signal.
**Actual Result:** Bullish +255 pts. Market rallied — possibly on relief of getting any data at all after the shutdown, plus core being inline.
**Verdict:** ❌

## Dec 18, 2025 — CPI Release (November 2025 Data) ⚠️ Oct Data Skipped

- Headline MoM (2-month Sep→Nov): Combined **0.2%** SA
- Core YoY: Actual **2.6%** vs Forecast 2.7% vs Previous 3.0% (Sep)
- Core MoM (2-month Sep→Nov): Combined **0.2%** SA

- Prior Close (Dec 17): 24,669
- Open: 24,984
- High: 25,413
- Low: 24,901
- Close: 25,262
- Direction: **Bullish (+2.40%)**

- Range: 512 pts

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** Significant cooling. YoY dropping from 3.0% to 2.7%, core from 3.0% to 2.6% — both below forecast. After months of re-acceleration fears, this is a major relief. Rate cut expectations should revive.
**Actual Result:** Bullish +593 pts from prior close. Massive rally.
**Verdict:** ✅

- Range: 243 pts

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** Below-consensus core readings. Inflation continuing to moderate. Should support risk assets and rate cut hopes.
**Actual Result:** Mild bearish -51 pts. Classic "buy the rumor, sell the news" — market had already rallied hard going into this.
**Verdict:** ❌

## Feb 13, 2026 — CPI Release (January 2026 Data)

- High: 24,996

- Close: 24,803
- Direction: Slight Bullish (+0.14%)

- Range: 417 pts

**My Prediction:** LONG
**Rationale:** Below-consensus headline. YoY dropping to 2.4% from 2.7%, a significant deceleration. Supports rate cut narrative. Bullish for NQ.
**Actual Result:** Modestly bullish (+35 pts from prior close), volatile intraday with 417pt range.
**Verdict:** ✅ (marginal — directionally correct but small move)

## 🔍 Patterns Observed

### 1. **"Hotter CPI = Bearish NQ" model FAILED in Q3 2025**
The simple framework (hotter → SHORT) was correct in Q1 (Feb, Jun) but completely broke down Jul–Oct 2025. Four consecutive hotter-than-expected CPI prints, four consecutive **bullish** NQ days. The market was in a strong uptrend (recovering from tariff lows) and simply ignored inflation data during this period.

### 2. **"Cooler CPI = Bullish NQ" model worked BETTER**
5 of 7 cooler/inline prints were bullish (71%). The two failures: Apr 10 (tariff crisis overwhelmed) and Jan 13 (sell the news after Dec rally). The cooler→LONG edge is stronger than hotter→SHORT.

### 3. **Macro context dominates**
The biggest lesson: CPI is NOT traded in isolation. Key events that overrode CPI signals:
- **Apr 10:** Cool CPI was irrelevant during peak tariff war (NQ -4.17%)
- **Jul-Oct:** Hot CPI was irrelevant during momentum recovery from tariff lows
- **Jan 13:** Cool CPI was irrelevant as market had already priced it in after the Dec rally

### 4. **Biggest moves came from biggest surprises in favorable macro context**
- Dec 18 (+593 pts): Cool CPI + market hungry for positive data after shutdown uncertainty = massive rally
- May 13 (+329 pts): Cool CPI confirming tariffs didn't spike inflation = recovery fuel

### 5. **Government shutdown created unique dynamics**
The Oct CPI skip and delayed releases (Oct 24 for Sep data, Dec 18 covering Sep-Nov) distorted normal patterns. Markets seemed to rally on getting data at all, regardless of content.

### 6. **Recommended Strategy Refinements**
- **Only trade CPI when macro regime is neutral** (not during tariff wars, shutdowns, etc.)
- **Focus on the LONG side** — cool CPI + neutral macro = highest conviction
- **Fade hotter CPI with caution** — the market often ignores hot prints during bullish trends
- **Watch the pre-release positioning** — if NQ has rallied 5%+ into CPI, even cool data can trigger "sell the news"
- **Use a wider stop or skip** when the VIX is >25 or during major geopolitical headlines

### 7. **50% accuracy = coin flip**
A simple "cooler→LONG, hotter→SHORT" framework on CPI alone is **not a standalone edge**. It needs filters:
- Trend direction (200 SMA, recent momentum)
- Positioning context (was it priced in?)
- Competing macro headlines (tariffs, shutdown, Fed meetings)
- Magnitude of surprise (only trade >0.1% deviation from consensus)

*This backtest uses daily NQ candles. For a more precise strategy, 1-minute or 5-minute candle data at 8:30 ET would be needed. The initial 1-5 minute reaction often differs significantly from the full-day close (see Feb 12, 2025 where the initial drop was ~300pts but the day ended flat).*
