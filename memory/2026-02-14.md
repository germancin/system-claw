## The Board — TradingClaw Trading Intelligence Platform (project direction)
User outlined a plan for an AI-driven trading intelligence + execution system for their trading group "The Board".

### Core strategies
1) **News Trading**: NFP, CPI, FOMC, PCE
- User provides the event calendar.
- **T-30 minutes** before each event, run an automated research/analysis job to gather all relevant info and deliver a **directional bias (LONG/SHORT)** plus reasoning and an actionable plan (entry / SL / TP) with a confidence rating.

2) **NYSE Open Breakout (Nasdaq)**
- Trade the **9:30 ET open** using a **3-minute candle**.
- At **9:33**, enter **LONG** if price breaks above the 9:30 candle high; enter **SHORT** if price breaks below the 9:30 candle low.
- Run a **9:00 ET daily cron** to gather exhaustive pre-market intelligence (news, prior global sessions, key Nasdaq movers, correlations like DXY/yields/VIX, etc.) to estimate likely direction for the next **15–20 minutes**.

### Roadmap / phases
- **Phase 1 (Advisory):** AI provides entries/SL/TP and bias; humans execute manually.
- **Phase 2 (Paper):** AI executes trades in simulation; validate process + accuracy.
- **Phase 3 (Live):** AI executes real trades via broker APIs, with real-time monitoring.

### Real-time execution requirements (future)
- Broker trading API (REST) for orders + modifications.
- **WebSocket market data** for real-time monitoring and automated management.
- Risk rule example (NYSE open): if price goes against the position by **>50% of the 9:30 candle range**, auto-close.

### Visibility & learning
- Build an interactive **dashboard** showing: strategies, data gathered, analysis, signals, entries/SL/TP, trade outcomes.
- The Board provides feedback (correct/incorrect) per prediction.
- System includes mandatory **post-mortems** on failures to identify what data/news/number was missed and to evolve rules/weights (continuous learning loop).

## Deliverables created
- Created an HTML dashboard mockup: `board-dashboard.html`
- Pushed to GitHub repo: https://github.com/germancin/system-claw (GitHub Pages can serve the HTML)
